Hi, I'm Zeshan and this is my blog. I'm a software engineer at Bazaarvoice, working towards building the world's smartest network.

I'm a simple person and I prefer, no demand, simple explanations. Anything of complexity can be broken down into smaller, simpler components. I'm also a big proponent on reasoning from first principles; removing facades to expose bare fundamental truths. Here is [Elon Musk][1] talking a bit about that.
 
 Welcome to my journey of learning. Here I will write about things I find interesting and share information I have found useful.
