Hi, I'm Zeshan and welcome to my blog. I'm a software engineer at Bazaarvoice, working on building the world's smartest network.

I prefer simple explanations. I believe anything of complexity can be broken down into simpler [components][1]. I'm also a big proponent on reasoning from first principles; removing facades to expose bare fundamental truths. Listen to [Elon Musk][2] talk about that.

One of my passions is to distill complex information and present it in a digestible format.

 Welcome to my journey of learning. Here I will take concepts I found difficult and explain them in an easy format.
