Hello there! My name is Zeshan and Iâ€™m currently employed as a Software Engineer. I am building a revolutionary real-time streaming data denormalization engine in Kafka.

I prefer simple explanations. I believe anything of complexity can be broken down into simpler [components][1]. I'm also a big proponent on reasoning from first principles; removing facades to expose bare fundamental truths. Listen to [Elon Musk][2] talk about that.

One of my passions is to [distill][distill] [complex][machine-learning] information and present it in a [digestible][explorable] format. Have you ever thought about what a 4D cube would look like? Check [this][tesseract] out.

Welcome to my blog! This is where I take [concepts][abstraction] I struggled with and explain them in a simple way - one post at a time.
