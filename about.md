Hey, my name is Zeshan. After many years of procrastination, deliberation, and hesitation, I've finally decided to start a blog.
Here I will write about things I find interesting and share information I have found useful. I want to take you along with me; on my journey of learning.
I hope you enjoy the musings of a stubborn programmer!
