A. Defining variables
Scala has two kinds of variables, `val` and `var`. A `val` is similar to a final variable
in java: once assigned, it cannot be reassigned. A `var` on the other hand, can be.

```java
val msg = "Hello, my name is Scala" // msg: String - type inferred
var msg2: String = "Hi!" // type explicitly given


// reassignment
msg = "New message" // will give an error
msg2 = "Bye Bye"
```


B. Defining functions

Let write a simple min function in Scala
```java
def min(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  if (x < y) x
  else y
}
```
A few things to note here:
1. Functions start with `def`
2. Function name is followed by comma-seperated list of parameters
3. A type must follow every parameter (x: Int)
4. The result type follow the parameter, after the closing parenthesis (list : Int)
5. There exists an equal sign (=) before function body
6. The last variable is what is returned, (either x or y)
