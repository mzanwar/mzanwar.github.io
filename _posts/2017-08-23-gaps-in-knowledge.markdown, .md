We all have weaknesses. The faster we acknowledge that, the better off we will
be. The breaks in our knowledge prevent us from doing things as efficiently as
possible.

#### How do we have gaps?
No one in the world understands every part of every system => everyone has
holes. There are many reasons why we have holes in our knowledge base. Some of  
us did not have a formal, 4 year education. Whatever the reason, it is
imperative that we plug them.

#### Background

Knowledge falls into four levels:
`A.` Things you know that you know
`B.` Things you don't know that you know
`C.` Things you know that you don't know
`D.` Things you don't know that you don't know


##### A. Things you know that you know
Everything that you know well, and understand fits in here. This is where you have the right amount of confidence in your skills and know how to apply your skills to maximum benefit. This is where you want to be to maximize your potential.


##### B. Things you don't know that you know
`Humility`, `Shy`, `Underachiever`, `Undervalued` - This is a weird transient state that falls between `A` and `C`. Some people never never move up from this state due to either a lack of confidence in their abilities or just a touch of the wrong kind of humility. Not where you want to be for the greatest utility.

##### C. Things you know that you don't know
`In progress` - This is a good place to list all your weaknesses when starting out.

##### D. Things you don't know that you don't know
`Arrogant` - This is without a doubt the worst level to be in. You will want to minimize this in your domain of knowledge. Be very careful not to fall into this trap. There are many things you will never know;



As you progress with your learning you'll move up a category, sometimes even leaping all the way to `A`. Often times, you'll also drop down a level. This may seem counter-intuitive but has a very simple explanation: as you learn new material, you also start getting a grasp on all the parts that you didn't know you didn't know `D`.

Imagine a computer science student who has just finished learning about control-flow statements in Java and falsely assumes they know everything about Java coding. He is then given a recursive tree-traversal problem to which he has no answer.

On a much more personal note, back in first year, I attempted to answer a BST traversal question on an exam using only if statements; not a proud memory of mine. During the exam I was confused as to why I was given only a few lines of empty space for my answer when I needed about two pages.

Another example is of Dynamic Programming. There exists a famous saying amongst CS students - when you think you've understood Dynamic Programming, thats when you know you haven't.
