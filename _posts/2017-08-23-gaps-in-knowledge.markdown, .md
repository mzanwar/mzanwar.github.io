> He that knows not, and knows not that he knows not is a fool

We all have weaknesses. The quicker we acknowledge this fact, the better off we will be. No one in the world understands every part of every system, everyone is a fool in some domain. There is nothing wrong with being a fool, but we must intentionally make an effort to not be one. Despite the various reasons we have gaps in our knowledge, it is **imperative** we try to plug them.



A budding student has just finished learning about control-flow statements and falsely assumes they can solve any problem given to them. If they are now given a problem that only has a recursive (tree-traversal) solution, they will fumble with . From personal experience, I attempted to answer a BST traversal question on an exam using only if statements; not a very proud memory of mine. During the exam I was confused as to why I was given only a few lines of empty space for my answer when I needed about two pages.



### Knowledge falls into four levels:

#### A. Things you know that you know
Everything that we know well, and understand fits in here. This is where we the right amount of confidence in your skills and know how to apply these skills to maximize benefit. This is where we want to be to reach our potential.


#### B. Things you don't know that you know
This is a weird transient state that falls between `A` and `C`. Some people never move up from this state due to either a lack of confidence in their abilities or just a touch of the wrong kind of humility. Not where we want to be for greatest utility.

#### C. Things you know that you don't know

This is a good place to list all your weaknesses when starting out.

#### D. Things you don't know that you don't know

We want to minimize our time in this state. We must be very careful not to fall into this trap. There are many things you will never know, but the ones you **should** know, you should know them very well.

As you progress with your learning you'll move up a category, sometimes even leaping all the way to `A`. Often times, you'll also drop down a level. This may seem counter-intuitive but has a very simple explanation: as you learn new material, you also start getting a grasp on all the parts that you didn't know you didn't know `D`.



In our next post we will discuss how to uncover these gaps and how to plug them.
