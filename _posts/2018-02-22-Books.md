Over the course of my software career, I've bought a ton of books that have
accumulated dust over the months. I'm a sucker for the physical medium - there
is nothing quite like flipping a page, highlighting, or drawing arrows and writing
notes directly on the paper. I also seem to learn better when reading from paper.
I think over the years I've becomes so skeptical of what I read on a screen that
seeing something on paper gives it some additional credibility. I know it seems silly but
thats just the way it is for me.

Many times, if I'm stuck following some convoluted piece of code, I will print
it out and walkthrough it on paper. I find it much more relaxing, and I always
come away with a deeper understanding of the code.

As a programmer, I spend most of my day looking at a screen. The change to a
paper is always something I look forward to and this gives eyes some much needed rest.
The problem is these books are mostly unread.

Thus, I have started an initiative whereby I will read a chapter a day and summarize
it in a blog post here.

I may have to change the cadence a little bit here and there, depending on how busy
I get at work but this will be a fun little experiment.
