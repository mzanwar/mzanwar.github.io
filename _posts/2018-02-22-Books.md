Over the course of my career, I've bought a ton of books that have
accumulated dust over the years. I'm a sucker for the physical medium - there is nothing quite like flipping a page, or writing
notes directly on the paper. I also seem to learn better when reading from physical paper.
I think over the years I've becomes so skeptical of what I read on a screen that
seeing something on paper gives it some additional credibility.

Sometimes, if I'm struggling with a particularly hairy piece of code, I will print
it out and work through it on paper. Most times, the convoluted logic on paper is much easier to digest. I also find it much more relaxing, and always come away with a deeper understanding of the code.

To add, most of my day is spent looking at a screen. The change to paper is always something I look forward to and it gives my eyes some much needed rest.

So back to the problem at hand: I have several unread books on my shelf that I want to
read but haven't had the chance to.

Thus, I have started an initiative whereby once I read a chapter, Iâ€™ll summarize
the difficult or interesting bits in a blog post.



Wish me luck!
