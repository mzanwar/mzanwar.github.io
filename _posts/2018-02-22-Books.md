I have a ton of books; most of which are left un


Over the course of my career, I've bought a ton of books that have
accumulated dust over the months. I'm a sucker for the physical medium - there
is nothing quite like flipping a page, or writing
notes directly on the paper. I also seem to learn better when reading from paper.
I think over the years I've becomes so skeptical of what I read on a screen that
seeing something on paper gives it some additional credibility.

Sometimes, if I'm struggling with a particularly hairy piece of code, I will print
it out and work through it on paper. Most times, the convoluted logic seems not as
convoluted. I also find it much more relaxing, and always
come away with a deeper understanding of the code.

As a programmer, most of my day is spent looking at a screen. The change to
paper is always something I look forward to and this gives my eyes some much needed rest.


So back to the problem at hand: I have several unread books on my shelf that I want to
read but haven't had the chance to.

Thus, I have started an initiative whereby I will read a chapter a day and summarize
it in a blog post here. The cadence may change a little bit but one chapter
doesn't seem to difficult.
