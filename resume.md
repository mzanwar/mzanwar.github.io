I am a passionate!

Hello there! My name is Zeshan and Iâ€™m currently employed as a Software Engineer.

I prefer simple explanations. I believe anything of complexity can be broken down into simpler [components][1]. I'm also a big proponent on reasoning from first principles; removing facades to expose bare fundamental truths. Listen to [Elon Musk][2] talk about that.

One of my passions is to [distill][distill] [complex][machine-learning] information and present it in a [digestible][explorable] format.

Welcome to my blog! This is where I take [concepts][abstraction] I struggled with and explain them in a simple way - one post at a time.
